# Data visualization

The team stems from __Group 2__ and consolidates of the following members:
- Nina Siwakoti
- Karthikan Vimalarasan
- Sathveekan Mohanabalan
- Wahid Tobias Winberg Razzaghi     

## Introduction
The introductory page consolidates the proposal as well as aspects to why the visualization of this data would occur. The dashboard is based upon research questions developed and will justify both the objectives and goals for the visualization design. When doing so, the visual encodings of processing data will be presented to accommodate the techniques used for each of the accomplished charts. The main thread of this dashboard is to construct a linear story of the motivation for the research conducted, while promoting a great use case for the theory and practices gathered from the Data Visualization course at University of Southern Denmark.

To navigate within dashboard proceed to the left sidebar. The tabs and their corresponding content is in a hierarchy starting from [Introduction] to [Download Project Report]. Each tab correlates to one or more variables to be visualized, whereas each section consolidates one or more subsections to answer the research questions accordingly. It is recommended to look through this page first before continuing onwards to get a proper understanding of the visualization to be conducted in the subsequent sections.

## Topic - World Development Indicators
The point of interest, problem as well as research questions to be conducted was conformed to the dataset provided by the World Bank. The World Bank is the primary collection of development indicators from officially international sources, and can be accessed here: 
[World Development Indicators - Databank](https://databank.worldbank.org/source/world-development-indicators)

## Point of interest
Before the team were to conduct a thorough research and visualization of data, a point of interest was stated for the project as the basis:

_"Compare the standard of living in different countries in correlation with the state of global development indicators."_

## Problem
Inherited by the point of interest, a problem was described and intended to be reviewed during data visualization which was as follows:

_"Standard of living around the world varies greatly"_

## Research questions
As a result from the problem, several research questions was developed to accommodate reviewing the problem previously mentioned:

1. "How has the global population growth progressed throughout the years?"

2. "Has the GDP of all countries grown positively within the last decade?"

3. "How large of a proportion of the countryâ€™s GDP is spent on education?"

4. "How has the death- and birth rate of different countries progressed over the years?"

5. "What gender has the highest life expectancy generally in the years past?"
