        p("Our work has led us to conclude that standard of living around the world varies greatly based on the evidence implied and highlighted when proposing the results as well as throughout the visualization design. The point of interest devised were to compare the standard of living in different countries in correlation with the state of global development indicators. To accommodate the interest, the utilization of data from The World Bank consolidating world development indicators in all countries were used to conduct the procedure. When approaching the study, considerations had to be made, whereas certain key features were utilized to benefit the research, which consolidated of line charts, bar charts, stacked bar charts, scatter plots as well as map charts. Interaction design and animations were subsequently added to the figures, to demonstrate the findings in a suitable manner through dashboard interaction. The findings of this study analyzed how the global population growth have progressed throughout the years while suggesting if the measurement of gross domestic product (GDP) of all countries have grown positively within the last decade. In correlation, further evidence has been provided to prove how large of a proportion of a country’s GDP is spent on education, whereas the progression of death- and birth-rate respectively is being demonstrated as well. Taken together, the analysis of what gender have the highest life expectancy in the years past is also outlined. We have obtained comprehensive results showing that the progression of the global population is evidently split into two categories, highest and lowest. It is primarily countries within the African region that propose the highest population growth, while due to the Russian/Ukrainian war in Europe, Ukraine had around 14.19% decrease in population growth which is above the double of what Bulgaria had, with a decent of 6.19%. However, by proceeding further back in time, there is no clear indication of what region concurrently have the most decrease in population growth, although there outliers were reported such as the Marshall Islands, Libya, and Lebanon. In regard to (GDP of all countries grown positively within the last decade) … (How large of a proportion of the country’s GDP is spent on education) … (How has the death- and birth rate of different countries progressed over the years?). Additionally, when averaging the life expectancy at birth for both male and female respectively, it is crucial to clarify that in every country provided within the results, females generally have a higher life expectancy at birth in correlation to males.

        p("Finally, the present research has only examined some of the many variables present for world development indicators, whereas many more observations can be conducted if the sample size of variables were to be increased for future work. This would however increase the number of research questions needed, as the variables would be limited to what answers they can provide. The results provided for visualization has so far have been very encouraging to highlight the potential for data science and data visualization. This implies the course conducted at University of Southern Denmark has enhanced the importance of during a thorough and comprehensive visualization design when highlighting research opportunities. Despite a trivial challenge in maintaining a coherent story to be explained when proposing the findings, there were no critical or serious challenges that hindered the project development. This was mainly due to the excellent exercises provided during the course as well as the provided theory and utilities by the lecturer to conduct data visualization. To further the research, we suggest that Artificial Intelligence is to be utilized for data visualization, as it is to become a transformative tool in areas such as coding. One of such tools could be VizGPT which has the ability to automatically generate complex data into visual elements.", style = "font-size:17px;"),
